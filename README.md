# Smart Mobility & Traffic Flow Optimization in Austin

This repository contains my copy of our BA 815 team project on **smart mobility in Austin** using **IoT Bluetooth sensor data**.

## Project Overview

We analyze Bluetooth detections from roadside sensors to:

- Build origin–destination (OD) pairs and travel times between segments  
- Identify the most common origins, destinations, and OD corridors  
- Detect peak-hour slowdowns and directional asymmetries (fast one way, slow the other)  
- Highlight geographic hotspots where congestion is concentrated  
- Provide data-driven recommendations for signal timing, corridor improvements, and future sensor placement  

## Files

- `A04_Smart_Mobility_and_Traffic_Flow_Optimization_in_Austin_Using_IoT_Bluetooth_Sensors.ipynb`  
  – Main analysis notebook (data cleaning, feature engineering, visualizations, and insights)

## Tools & Tech

- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib / seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Tableau (for dashboards and charts)
- SQL / ERD design for the sensor data model

This repo is meant to document my individual work and final deliverables for the course.
